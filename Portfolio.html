        Synopsis
        Setting
        In Taishō era Japan, a secret organization known as the "Demon Slayer Corps" has waged a war against demons for
        centuries. Demons are former humans who possess supernatural abilities such as enhanced strength, rapid regeneration,
        and unique powers referred to as "Blood Demon Arts". Demons can only be killed if they are exposed to direct sunlight,
        decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy called Nichirin, or injected with a poison extracted from wisteria
        flowers.
        
        In contrast, the Demon Slayers are entirely human but employ specialized elemental breathing techniques known as
        "Breathing Styles". These techniques grant them superhuman strength, heightened abilities, and increased resilience that
        enable them to fight demons effectively. The most formidable Demon Slayers are known as the "Hashira" and gain this
        title through multiple advancements in the Corps' ranks, culminating in killing fifty demons at the highest level or a
        member of the Twelve Kizuki.
        
        Plot
        Main article: List of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba characters
        Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. After his father's
        death, he became his family's breadwinner and travels to the nearby village to sell charcoal. One day, Tanjiro comes
        home to discover his family was slaughtered by a demon. His sister Nezuko is the sole survivor of the incident; though
        she has been transformed into a demon, Nezuko still shows signs of human emotion and thought. Following an encounter
        with Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is sent to train with Giyu's former instructor
        Sakonji Urokodaki in becoming a Demon Slayer and begins his quest to help Nezuko turn into a human again.
        
        Two years later, Tanjiro learns the "Water Breathing" style and takes part in a formidable exam. He is one of the few to
        pass, officially making him a member of the Corps. Sakonji has hypnotized Nezuko to not harm humans and she aids Tanjiro
        in dire situations as he starts his work of hunting down and slaying demons. One of their assignments bring them to
        Asakusa where they encounter Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one responsible for the murder of
        their family. Tanjiro and Nezuko also meet Tamayo and Yushiro, two demons free from Muzan's control. They ally to
        develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply Tamayo with blood samples from the Twelve Kizuki,
        the twelve most powerful demons under Muzan's command, split into the six Lower Ranks and the six Upper Ranks.
        
        Along their journey, Tanjiro and Nezuko meet fellow Demon Slayers Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira; they team up
        after Tanjiro's mission to kill Kyogai, the former Lower Six. They later join other Demon Slayers in facing the family
        of Lower Five Rui. In the midst of battle, Tanjiro unlocks a mysterious Breathing Style known as "Hinokami Kagura", but
        Rui ultimately outmatches him, while Inosuke and Zenitsu are injured and the expedition is slaughtered. Giyu and Insect
        Hashira Shinobu Kocho rescue the survivors, who are brought back to the Corps' headquarters. Tanjiro is put on trial by
        the Hashira – Giyu, Shinobu, Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui, Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji,
        Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima, Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito, Serpent Hashira Obanai Iguro, and Wind Hashira Sanemi
        Shinazugawa – who, with the exception of Giyu and Mitsuri, do not believe he and Nezuko should be allowed to live.
        Nonetheless, the Corps' leader Kagaya Ubuyashiki, is able to convince them to accept Nezuko and see Tanjiro's
        importance, believing it is with their help that Muzan can be defeated.
        
        Angered by Rui's death, Muzan kills the Lower Ranks due to their constant failures; he spares Lower One Enmu and tasks
        him with killing Tanjiro. After a battle against Enmu in a passenger train, Tanjiro kills him with Kyojuro's support.
        However, Upper Three Akaza appears and battles Kyojuro, who dies from his wounds as the demon escapes. Months later, the
        group is sent to Yoshiwara with Tengen, where they face off and kill the Upper Six siblings Gyutaro and Daki. Tengen
        retires from the Corps after suffering extensive injuries. During another battle at the Swordsmith Village, where the
        Corps' weapons are forged, Tanjiro meets Sanemi's younger brother Genya, who has the mysterious ability to temporarily
        gain demonic powers after eating their flesh. With the help of Muichiro and Mitsuri, the group kill Upper Five Gyokko
        and Upper Four Hantengu. In the aftermath, they discover that Nezuko is immune to sunlight. She becomes Muzan's prime
        target as he has long sought a way to overcome the sun and become immortal. Tanjiro also learns his Hinokami Kagura
        descends from "Sun Breathing", the first Breathing Style created by Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the most powerful Demon Slayer
        in history, and develops it to fight Muzan.
        
        Knowing Muzan will attempt to find Nezuko, the Corps enacts strict training to prepare its members for the coming
        conflict. Tamayo develops a serum with the obtained blood samples to cure Nezuko, who is kept in isolation as she
        recovers. Muzan appears and Kagaya triggers a suicide attack to stagger him. The Hashira ambush Muzan but he traps them
        all within the Infinity Castle, an endless labyrinth housing Akaza, Upper Two Doma, Upper One Kokushibo, and the
        newly-ascended members Kaigaku and Nakime: Zenitsu's former partner and Muzan's personal assistant respectively. As
        Zenitsu kills Kaigaku, Tamayo injects Muzan with a poison she and Shinobu have made to weaken his abilities. When Akaza
        remembers his human life, he betrays Muzan and commits suicide, while Shinobu sacrifices herself to poison Doma,
        allowing her protégé Kanao Tsuyuri and Inosuke to kill him. After a harrowing battle, Kokushibo kills both Muichiro and
        Genya before being killed as well. Muzan kills Tamayo, and later Nakime when she is hypnotized by Yushiro to use her
        powers against him, but he is forced above ground by the Corps.
        
        Aided by Tamayo's poison, the Corps unleash a desperate battle of attrition as the remaining members fight to stall
        Muzan until the morning sun can kill him. Muzan is left helpless against the sun but Gyomei, Obanai, and Mitsuri succumb
        to their injuries. As Tanjiro delivers the final blow, Muzan fatally wounds him and forcefully gives him his remaining
        blood. Tanjiro is transformed into a demon as Muzan's last-ditch effort to have his species survive. He begins to attack
        the survivors but through their efforts and Nezuko's aid, who has been fully restored to her human self, the
        transformation is reversed. In the aftermath of the battle, the Corps are disbanded, leaving Giyu and Sanemi as the last
        surviving Hashira.
        
        Muzan's death has effectively vanquished all demons under his control while Yushiro goes to live as a painter. Tanjiro
        and Nezuko return to their home, accompanied by Zenitsu and Inosuke. Tanjiro and Inosuke marry Kanao and fellow Demon
        Slayer Aoi Kanzaki, respectively, while Zenitsu marries Nezuko. In a modern-day epilogue, the descendants and
        reincarnations of the Corps members enjoy a peaceful life free of demons.
        
        Production
        After Gotouge's manga, Haeniwa no Zigzag, published in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 2015, failed to become a serialized work,
        Tatsuhiko Katayama, Gotouge's first editor, suggested Gotouge to start a series with an "easy-to-understand theme".[5]
        Gotouge's debut work Kagarigari would become the basis for an initial draft, titled Kisatsu no Nagare (鬼殺の流れ) since it
        had concepts like swords and demons, which would be familiar to the Japanese audience.[5] However, due to its serious
        tone, lack of comic relief, and dark story, this draft was not accepted for serialization, so Katayama asked Gotouge to
        try writing a brighter, more normal character in the same setting.[5] The original title was Kisatsu no Yaiba (鬼殺の刃),
        but they felt the character "satsu" (殺, lit. "kill") in the title was too overt. Although it is a made-up word,
        "kimetsu" (鬼滅) seemed easy to understand, so Gotouge thought it would be interesting to abbreviate the series' title
        that way; the word "yaiba" (刃, lit. "blade") implies a Japanese sword.[5] According to Gotouge, the series' three
        biggest influences are JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Naruto and Bleach.[6][7] Tatsuhiko Katayama, an editor of the Demon
        Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba manga, has said in interviews that the red-haired, scar-faced Tanjiro was inspired by Rurouni
        Kenshin, a 1990s manga about a similarly drawn swordsman, Himura Kenshin.[8]

        <h5>In 2020, the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba franchise generated an estimated annual sales revenue of ¥1 trillion ($8.75
        billion).[94][95][96] In January 2021, it was reported that Japanese sales of print books and magazines fell 1% in 2020
        compared to the previous year, being the smallest per-year decline since 2006. This small decline was attributed to an
        increase in reading in Japan due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the "successful boom" of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no
        Yaiba manga and its related publications.[97] According to CharaBiz, a database for character licensing business in
        Japan, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is the highest-grossing franchise of 2020, surpassing other well-known franchises
        such as Anpanman, Pokémon, Mickey Mouse and Peanuts (Snoopy).[98]
        
        According to a 2020 internet poll conducted by Oricon Monitor Research, over 90% of the Japanese public is familiar with
        Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba; 40.5% said that they were "very familiar", 57.3% said that they were "familiar with the
        name", indicating that 97.8% knew the existence of the series. Of the 1,558 respondents who said that they were "very
        familiar", 1,182 respondents "like" or "very liked" the series. To the question of "what part of the series do you
        like?", the series' story was the most popular aspect with 76.4% votes, followed by the setting with 49.3% and the
        relatability of the characters with 45.3% votes. 31% of the fans said that they owned the manga, and of the 66.1% of
        those fans said they owned every volume. According to multiple respondents, the series helped them treasure and connect
        with their families and allowed people of different generations to connect even in the workplace and beyond. The poll
        was responded from November 18–24 by 3,848 members of Oricon Monitor Research, ranging from people in their teens to
        their sixties.[99] The series helped to increase internal tourism, with many tourists traveling to similar spots to the
        ones featured in the series.[100][101][102][103] It has been featured in Japanese high school textbooks starting in
        2022.[104][105]
        
        Regarding the series' sudden huge success, Weekly Shōnen Jump editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano stated that the manga
        sales shot up straight after its anime adaptation finished, explaining that a large number of people watched the series
        through streaming services after it ended rather than watching it weekly. Nakano also stated that it is harder for a
        manga series running in the magazine to become a hit, and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba despite having started in
        February 2016, did not become a major hit until late 2019, adding that its success "hinged on word of mouth generated
        after the anime's run".[106] Nakano have also said it introduced many new people and audience into Jump.[107] On
        December 20, 2020, at the Jump Festa '21, Mayumi Tanaka, voice actress of One Piece's Monkey D. Luffy, read aloud a
        message from One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda, in which he praised Gotouge's series, and wrote: "At Jump, Demon Slayer was
        really amazing. I enjoyed how it was able to save the feelings of so many people. Absolutely superb work. This is how I
        want manga to be. It touched me, somehow!".[108]
        
        Yusuke Murata said that the series' contribution to the industry as a whole is immeasurable,[109] while Gege Akutami
        commented that the series created many new manga fans.[110] The incumbent, Fumio Kishida, has remarked that he was a fan
        of the series, pledging that he would improve the conditions in the manga and anime industry.[111][112] Several
        politicians even used motifs and patterns from the series in their campaigns in 2021.[113][114]

        million, 5.029 million, and 5.009 million copies, respectively, being the first manga volumes to sell over 5 million

        The manga occupied the entire top 10 for a full month, and it was also the first series in Oricon's history to occupy
        the entire top 19 weekly rank.[143][144] In October 2020, the twenty-two volumes, at the time, of the series occupied

        Critical response
        Before its anime series adaptation, Nicholas Dupree of Anime News Network included the series on his list of "The Most
        Underrated Shonen Jump Manga", and wrote: "Kimetsu is still arguably an oddity in Jump, but it's firmly established its
        style that's certainly worth looking out for."[162] Rebecca Silverman of the same website ranked the first volume as a
        B−. Silverman praised the plot ideas and characters but had issues with its pacing. She labeled Gotouge's art as
        "unpolished and inconsistent," although she commended details such as those in Tanjiro and Nezuko's clothing which
        illustrate both the poverty and loving environment from where they come. Silverman concluded that it is the work of a
        promising author and had positive expectations for the series' development.[163]
        
        Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave the first volume a score of 9/10. He commended the series for its "ability to
        convey power in simplicity," explaining that Gotouge's art is "nice" but overly detailed, and the dialogue and
        exposition are straightforward. Douresseaux praised its characters and recommended the series to fans of demon-fighting
        heroes.[164] Nick Smith of ICv2 gave the first volume a score of 4/5. He wrote that the story is well crafted and the
        characters intriguing, but the setting is "too deadly for the survival of the human race." Smith said that the artwork
        is good but not special and recommended the series to "teens and adults who like heroes fighting back against horrific
        evil."[165] Che Gilson of Otaku USA praised the series for its plot, action and character development. Gilson said that
        the art is "stiff", but that instead of looking like rough drawings or traced photo composites, the series "looks as if
        it were carved and printed from woodblocks." Gilson concluded: "With an engrossing plot and characters, Volume 1 builds
        to a cliffhanger that makes it hard to wait for the next volume."[166] Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post criticized the
        first chapter for being "overly wordy when just the action would suffice," and ultimately called it "a work-in-progress
        series."[167] After having watched the anime adaptation, Melina Dargis of the same website was so fascinated by the
        story and characters that she decided to go back and review the second volume of the manga. Despite knowing what would
        happen, Dargis wrote that it was "still such a delight to relive it again" and concluded; "It's a really great story and
        appeals to a wide variety of interests."[168]
        
        Manga artists have lauded the series; Yoshihiro Togashi wrote a praising comment featured on the obi of series fourth
        volume;[169][170] Osamu Akimoto wrote a praising comment featured on the obi of the series' fifth volume;[171] Takayuki
        Yamaguchi praised the series and recommended it in a 2018 interview, around the time of its tenth volume.[172] Author
        Kinoko Nasu called it one of his favorite new manga works.[173] Comedian and novelist Naoki Matayoshi also praised the
        series.[174] Nobuyuki Izumi of Real Sound compared the series' premise, setting, and structure to Hirohiko Araki's
        JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's first two parts, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, and to Kazuhiro Fujita's Ushio &
        Tora.[175]</h6>
